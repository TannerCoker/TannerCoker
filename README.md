# About Me
Hello, my name is Tanner and I'm a senior Computer Science student at Texas State University. I have a minor in Mathematics and plan on going into software engineering 
or devlopment post-graduation. I enjoy programming when I have time and I enjoy the satisfying feeling of when I finally figure out how to overcome an problem that I was
encountering on an assignment. I learn best with hands-on experience and try to come up with projects to do that will help me learn a new skill. 

## Skills
- I work well in teams and have experience with Agile programming when I was working in a small group during my software engineering course in a past semester. 
- I have experience in Java, C/C++, and Python.
